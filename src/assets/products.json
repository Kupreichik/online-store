      "description": "Silver Point is a Rex Begonia hybrid known for its showy foliage with bold colors and iridescence. Although you won’t find this hybrid in the wild, it requires similar care to other Rex Begonias: medium to bright indirect sun, moist (but not wet) potting mix, and high humidity. Avoid misting its leaves, which can encourage mildew. This plant is an excellent pick for plant parents looking to test out a new variety.",
